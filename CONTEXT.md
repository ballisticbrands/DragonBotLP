# DragonBot landing page
This is the landing page for DragonBot.
You can view the DragonBot project here:
https://github.com/ballisticbrands/DragonBot

## Structure
* header/hero section - clearly explaining what this is - a chatbox animation similar to the ones shown in more detail at the features section below showing the capabilities of dragonbot. this should be paired with an animation showing the dragonbot being connected to all of their services - Google drive/sheets, amazon seller central, the open web, their notion, their slack, and 266+ other services (we'll replace "266" with whatever random number - to give them ease of mind that it will connect to their service).
* AI advantage section - tell them about AI adoption for ecommerce and scare them that their competitors already do it. put a placeholder here for now that will say "Your business NEEDS AI".
* DragonBot offer - "what you get with dragonbot" - 4 columns - column 1: "Access to all of the most advance AI tools in one place", some placeholder text below it - column 2: "A 24/7/365 virutal ecommerce assistant - always on, always ready", some placeholder text below it - column 3: PLACEHOLDER - column 4: PLACEHOLDER
* features sections - a number of sections showing what sellers can do with the bot. each of these sections will have a chatbox animation showing how the bot works (showing a chat box with the bot and then the bot doing something as a response). put this into one section with a few buttons at the top ("Keyword research", "Customer support", etc...) that when the user clicks it will show them a different video
** kw research - user typing into slack "yo dragon here are 10 competitor ASIN's, plz do keyword research on them and upload the result as a google sheet to the project's folder. 10 ASINS PASTED HERE". the dragonbot will then spit out messages like "researching competitor ASINs", "checking which keywords they rank for", "finding root keywords", "finding never keywords", "creating sheet", "done! LINK PASTED HERE. plz have a look and let me know your thoughts! 🐉"
* * product research - a similar sequence
* * customer support - a similar sequence

* Plans section - "$0 demo call" - "~$150~ FREE setup + $39/mo (commitment to 3 months)" (the ~~ denotes strikethrough) - $150~ FREE setup + $99/mo (commitment to 3 months)" - each section will have features listed underneath it, put placeholders for now
