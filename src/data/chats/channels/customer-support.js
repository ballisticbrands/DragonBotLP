I\'m so sorry to hear about the missing piece — I completely understand how frustrating that must be, especially for a gift. I\'d like to send you a full replacement right away at no cost. Could you confirm the shipping address you\'d like it sent to? We\'ll get it out as fast as possible."\n\n*Based on: Damaged item template (adapted for missing piece)*\n\n⚠️ **Note:** The template covers damaged items but not specifically missing pieces.
