Players use them to carry their Commander/MTG decks to game nights and tournaments. Premium ones like MagVault use magnetic closures instead of basic snap-lids.\n\nThree competitors on Amazon:\n\n1. Ultra Pro Satin Tower — the market leader in deck boxes\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NB7BJKW\n2. Ultimate Guard Boulder — popular magnetic-style deck box\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHJ2SKRK\n3.

    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Got it. I\'ve now read everything. Here\'s my understanding:\n\n**The Keyword Research Process (Ballistic Brands method):**\n\n1. **Find top 10 competitors** — ASINs of products very similar to yours (same size, type, design theme)\n2. **Run them through reverse ASIN keyword analysis** — to extract all keywords those competitors rank for\n3. **Filter the raw keyword list** — remove irrelevant junk\n4. **Identify Root Keywords** — the core search terms (e.g., "card vault", "card organizer", "card storage box"). These are the broad concepts.\n5. **Identify Never Keywords** — terms that indicate a *different* product (e.g., "tray" if you\'re selling a box). These get excluded.\n6. **Build the Master List** — copy raw keywords, remove any lines containing never keywords\n7. **Extract Single Words** — run word frequency analysis on the master list to get individual words sorted by frequency\n8. **Skip Titan\'s Step 4** — no need to split keywords by root keyword into separate sheets (overkill per Gershon)\n\n**How these lists get used:**\n- **Master List** → PPC **exact match** campaigns (target each keyword exactly)\n- **Root Keywords** → PPC **broad match** campaigns (minus never keywords as negatives)\n- **Single Words** → listing optimization (title, bullets, backend)\n\nNo questions — the process is clear. **Which product are we doing this for?** 🐉' },

I don\'t have specifics like: what size cards it holds, materials, price point, what makes it different from other deck boxes, whether it\'s already listed on Amazon or a new launch, ASIN, etc.\n\nTo do good keyword research, I need to understand:\n\n1. What is it exactly? (magnetic closure deck box for MTG/Pokemon/etc?)\n2. What makes it unique? (magnetic, premium feel, specific capacity?)\n3. What it is NOT (so I can build good never keywords)\n4. Is it already on Amazon? (existing ASIN or new product launch?)\n5. Who are the competitors? (or should I find them?)\n\nFill me in and I\'ll get started.

HOWEVER, we will be releasing the MagDiceTray at the same time - which is a magnetically attached extension to the magvault which is a dice tray. so I do want to inclue "dice tray" (and variations) in the listing text, because I want people who search for "dice tray" as well to see our listings - because it\'s relevant to them.\n4. no\n5. "realm guard" has the "vault" tcg deck box (comes in different designs) - here\'s an example asin: B0F7H1G52K. here are some other ASINs of other companies with similar products: B0F9XYRSFF B0FN47FNRM B0D264D63X\n\ninclude asins from 10 different brands (if you can find). for each brand - get their most popular deck box design. make sure you only get brands who have deck boxes in different designs of course first step - suggest relevant asins to me that we\'ll use for the kw research' },

"lorcana" IS in the bullets.

The important functional words (deck, box, card, mtg, case, storage, magic, commander, tcg, etc.) are all covered.\n\nHere\'s what\'s in the sheet now:\n\n**Title (193 chars):**\n> TabletopKings MagVault Magnetic Deck Box for MTG Commander – Holds 100+ Sleeved Cards – Premium TCG Card Case & Storage Organizer for Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Lorcana Trading Card Games\n\n**5 Bullet Points** covering:\n1. Product specs (magnetic, 100+ cards, game compatibility)\n2. Storage & protection\n3. Art designs\n4. Portability\n5. Gift angle\n\n**Counters included:**\n- Title character count (193/200)\n- Title word count\n- Each bullet\'s character count\n- Total bullet characters\n- Keyword coverage breakdown (in title / in bullets / unused)\n- Top 30 unused words for quick review\n- Full word-by-word detail table\n\nTake a look — the unused words section makes it easy to spot if anything important is missing.

    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Now about the MagDiceTray bullet — here\'s my assessment:\n\n**⚠️ TOS Flag: Cross-promoting another product in bullet points**\n\nAmazon\'s product detail page policies state that bullet points should describe the **listed product\'s features and benefits**. Mentioning a separately sold product (MagDiceTray) is a gray area:\n\n- **Allowed:** Mentioning compatibility — e.g., "Compatible with our MagDiceTray magnetic dice tray (sold separately)"\n- **Risky:** Actively advertising/promoting another product — e.g., "Pair your MagVault with our MagDiceTray!"\n- **Not allowed:** Including links, ASINs, or directing customers to other listings\n\nThe way I wrote it ("Pair your MagVault with our MagDiceTray, a magnetically attached dice tray sold separately") leans promotional. Many sellers do this, but it could technically trigger a listing review.\n\n**Safer alternatives:**\n1. Mention it as a compatibility note: "Compatible with magnetically attached dice trays (sold separately)"\n2. Put the cross-sell in A+ Content / Brand Story instead (that\'s explicitly designed for it)\n3. Create a virtual bundle listing\n\nWant me to tone down that bullet to be safer, or are you comfortable with the current wording given it\'s common practice?' },
