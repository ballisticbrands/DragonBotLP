    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Checking Notion for customer support templates...\n\nFound them! Under **Customer Support SOPs** I can see:\n\n* **Shipping delay** — tracking update + estimated delivery\n* **Refund request** — 30-day policy, return label instructions\n* **Exchange request** — size/color swap process\n* **Damaged item** — replacement or refund offer\n* **Where is my order** — carrier lookup + tracking link\n* **General inquiry** — friendly redirect to FAQ or escalate\n\n6 templates total, all loaded into my memory. Ready for the next step. 🐉' },
    { role: 'user', name: 'Gershon', text: 'perfect. now, I need to make sure you\'re connected to our shopify and amazon seller central accounts. can you verify both connections?' },
    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Let me check both connections...\n\n✅ **Amazon Seller Central** — Connected. I can see all 4 brands (TabletopKings, PuzzlesRUs, Kitchenfun, Performics). Buyer messages API is active.\n\n✅ **Shopify** — Connected. I have access to 3 stores (TabletopKings, PuzzlesRUs, Kitchenfun). I can read and respond to customer messages through the Shopify inbox.\n\nBoth channels are live and I can pull incoming messages in real time. What\'s the plan? 🐉' },
    { role: 'user', name: 'Gershon', text: 'ok here\'s what I want:\n\nfor every incoming customer message (from Amazon or Shopify) - write it to the #customer-support channel. include the customer\'s message and your suggested response based on the Notion templates. if you\'re not sure about something or the message doesn\'t fit any template, you can ask questions too.' },
    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Got it! So for every incoming message I\'ll post to **#customer-support** with:\n\n1. **Source** (Amazon / Shopify) + order number\n2. **Customer\'s message**\n3. **My suggested response** based on the closest Notion template\n4. If I\'m unsure → I\'ll flag it and ask you for guidance\n\nShould I send the responses automatically, or wait for your approval first? 🐉' },
    { role: 'user', name: 'Gershon', text: 'wait for my approval. I\'ll tell you on the #customer-support channel whether to send it or if we need to change something. also - always include a link to the amazon or shopify conversation page. both when you post the incoming message and when you send the reply.' },
    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Perfect, here\'s the full workflow:\n\n**Incoming message →**\n1. I post to #customer-support: source, order #, customer message, my suggested response, + **direct link** to the conversation on Amazon/Shopify\n2. You review and either approve ✅ or tell me to adjust\n3. Once approved, I send the response to the customer\n4. I confirm it\'s sent with the conversation link again so you can verify\n\n**If I\'m unsure →**\n* I\'ll flag it in #customer-support with what I\'m confused about\n* Wait for your guidance before suggesting a response\n\nThis way nothing goes out without your sign-off. Want me to activate this now? 🐉' },
    { role: 'user', name: 'Gershon', text: 'yes activate it. let\'s go 🔥' },
    { role: 'bot', name: 'DragonBot', text: 'Customer support automation is **live!** 🔥\n\n* Monitoring: Amazon Seller Central (all 4 brands) + Shopify inbox\n* Templates: 6 Notion SOPs loaded\n* Responses: Draft → your approval → send → link back to you\n* Channel: #customer-support\n\nI\'ll post the first message as soon as one comes in. You\'ll see everything in #customer-support before any response goes out. 🐉' },
