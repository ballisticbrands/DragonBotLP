Here\'s the breakdown:\n\n* **1,188 pages** across the workspace\n* **9 databases** (products, brands, SOPs, suppliers, etc.)\n* Thousands of blocks — I indexed the full structure\n\nFull index saved to notion-index.json.

I don\'t need to read every single page, just the ones with key business info.\n\nFor the **daily sync** — that\'s a great idea. Here\'s how I\'d do it:\n\n1. Check Notion API for pages modified since last sync\n2. Read each changed page\'s content\n3. Determine if changes are important enough to update my memory (new brands, products, SOPs, strategy changes = YES; trivial edits = NO)\n4. Update my knowledge base accordingly\n5. Send you a summary on #dragonbot-updates of what changed\n\nWant me to do the full deep read now and then set up the daily sync? 🐉' },

Sends summary to #dragonbot-updates\n* **Smart filtering:** Only updates memory for meaningful changes (new brands, products, SOPs, strategy).
